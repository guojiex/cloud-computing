# Write or invoke the code to perform filtering on the dataset. Redirect

# HINT1: You should write a function to get the answer to each question.
# Do not just echo the answer.
# HINT2: Please remember if there is no entry that satisfies the filtering requirements,
# especially for Q5-Q8, your code should return 0 rather than nothing.
